# python-box

This repository contains my code I wrote when learning Python 3. The reference is [the Python 3 official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html), such as the _Library reference_ and _Language reference_.

Most of the code is written as unit tests. My rationale is that with unit tests I could write assertions (i.e., `self.assertX`) so one can understand the expectation by simply reading the code without having to execute it (but surely one can run the code as well).

## How to run the code

- `cd py3`
- Run `./py3.x.sh 13 <py-file-path>` to execute the demo code using Python 3.13.
  - For example: `./py3.x.sh 13 lib/io/io_demo.py`
